### Thought Process

1. **Framework Selection**: Using Spring Boot for its simplicity in creating standalone applications and managing dependencies.

2. **Command-Line Runner**: Utilized the `CommandLineRunner` interface to execute loading and processing methods upon application startup.

3. **Modular Structure**: Maintained a modular structure by separating models and services and enhances maintainability and readability.

4. **File Handling**: The file handling logic is similar, and the application reads from specified resource files.
